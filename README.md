#SMS Delight RESTful APIs

The SMS Delight RESTful APIs are a set of backend services built using Node.js, JavaScript, PostgreSQL, and Express framework to power the SMS Delight mobile application. These APIs serve as the bridge between the front end of the app and the server, allowing users to send bulk SMS messages to their contacts.
Overall, the SMS Delight RESTful APIs provide a secure and efficient backend for the SMS Delight mobile app, offering seamless communication capabilities and a user-friendly experience for sending bulk SMS messages to contacts. The combination of Node.js, JavaScript, Express, JWT, and PostgreSQL ensures high performance, scalability, and data security for the application.

## Features
<ul>
<li>User Authentication: The APIs implement JWT (JSON Web Token) for secure user authentication, allowing registered users to access protected endpoints.</li>
<li>Sending SMS: Users can send bulk SMS messages to their contacts by making a POST request to the appropriate API endpoint. The API processes the request and delivers the SMS messages to the specified recipients.
</li>
<li>Managing Contacts: Users can manage their contact lists by adding, updating, or deleting contacts. This is achieved through dedicated API endpoints that interact with the PostgreSQL database to store and retrieve contact information.
</li>
<li>User Profile: Users can view and update their profiles through dedicated API endpoints, ensuring a personalized experience within the app.</li>
<li>Error Handling: The APIs implement robust error handling to provide meaningful error messages and status codes in case of any issues.</li>
<li>Database Management: The APIs use PostgreSQL as the database to store user data, contacts, and message templates. CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations are performed to interact with the database.</li>
<li>Automated Deployment: The APIs are set up with a CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) pipeline, enabling automatic deployment to ensure smooth updates and efficient development cycles.</li>
</ul>
